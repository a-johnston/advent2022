Run from git root with py3 as such:
```
./main.py dayN [args] [p1,p2]
```
where p1 or p2 select which part to run where solutions between parts aren't
incorporated together. Any additional arguments are passed to the solver method
for the given day as strings. For the given day argument, the solver is run
against each text file in the module's folder.
